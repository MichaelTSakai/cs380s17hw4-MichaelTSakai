I spent most of my time trying to figure out the functions in
HNode.h (like the update and get function). I still didn't figure
out how it's supposed to work. 

The second most time consuming work involved understanding how to 
implement Heap using a vector. Lots of out of boundary errors. 

Hours it took: probably around 8 - 10 hours
